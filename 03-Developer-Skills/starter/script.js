// Set a goal!
    // specific, measurable, realistic and time-based
// Don't copy-paste code, understand it
// Reinforce newly learned code, try it and use it
    // challenge yourself
// Practice, practice, practice
// You can always refactor code later
// Embrace the fact that you will never know everything
// Don't lose motivation!
